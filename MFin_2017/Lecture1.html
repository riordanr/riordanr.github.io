## Financial Markets

&gt; "Markets are fascinating. They change constantly as prices adjust to new information, as winning traders replace losing traders, and as new technologies evolve. Highly skilled professional traders employ clever strategies in the search for trading profits. They ultimately profit from investors, gamblers, and foolish traders. The stakes in some markets are very high. Traders may arrange multimillion-dollar trades in seconds. They sometimes make or lose fortunes overnight. The prices that traders negotiate ultimately determine how market-based economies allocate their scarce resources. Free economies owe much of their wealth to their well functioning markets" &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

## The Blockchain

The blockchain is a distributed ledger system that manages Bitcoin transactions. Blockchain is a shared, unfalsifiable ledger for recording the history of (digital) transactions. It is open for all to see and relies on a distributed network of "verifiers" to manage its integrity.

## Robo-Advisers

&gt; "The longer answer is that a robo-advisor is a service that uses highly specialized software to do the job of wealth managers or investment advisors – people who decide what type of investments you should be making and then tinker with those investments over time. Robo-advisors typically have you, the investor, answer a few questions to determine your appetite for risk and then, through the use of proprietary algorithms, spread your money into appropriate investments, making adjustments as your situation and the market change. They typically collect around 1% less in fees than a professional investment advisor. Robo-advisors invest primarily in ETFs."
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

## How do Robo-Advisors Stack Up?

&lt;/div&gt;

## How will Robo-Advisers Hold Up During a Recession?

Passive investments may work well when markets are *increasing*. There is a saying that "a rising tide floats all boats." Robo-advisers have yet to deal with truly negative or **crashing markets**. How will they, and importantly, their clients deal with **losses**?
